=head1 NAME

Perinci::Access::Manual - Perinci::Access manual

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.39 of Perinci::Access::Manual (from Perl distribution Perinci-Access), released on 2014-10-24.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perinci::Access (P::A for short) is family of L<Riap> client/server libraries.
It allows you to access code entities and its L<Rinci> metadata from Perl.

=head1 MODULE ORGANIZATION

L<Perinci::Access> is a front-end interface for all of the
L<Perinci::Access::Base>-based (regular) Riap clients. Each transport protocol
will have its own specific backend module, e.g. for accessing in-process/Perl
modules and functions you have L<Perinci::Access::Perl>, for accessing Riap over
HTTP you have L<Perinci::Access::HTTP::Client> and so on. When you pass a URL to
Perinci::Access, it will check its URL scheme and pass to the appropriate
backend.

L<Perinci::Access::Lite> is the exception from these and is not under the
Perinci::Access umbrella. It is designed to be lightweight (especially in terms
of startup overhead), has less features, and used by L<Perinci::CmdLine::Lite>.

=head1 CONCEPTS

Please read up on L<Rinci> and L<Riap> first.
